      <description>HTB MonitorsTwo WriteUp MonitorsTwo was the first live box that I did so had to do it without any help. It was an easy linux box with some container escaping and Docker privelege escalation. Great fun!
Enumeration A goal of mine has been to enumerate fully before going down rabbit holes, even in these CTF situations. This is the methodology that is going to help me in real world scenarios so I need to get the practice down now.</description>

      <description>This is a space to compile books that I have read that I believe provide great value to my growth as a security professional.
Red Team: Development and Operations- Joe Vest &amp;amp; James Tubberville Finished - 9/1/2023
This was as great look into the operations of a professional red team. It challenged my preconceived notions of red teaming/adversary emulation and how it differs from traditional penetration testing engagements.</description>

      <description>HTB &amp;ldquo;Bounty&amp;rdquo; Writeup This was a windows box that taught me some new techniques and refreshed some old ones.
Enumeration Started out with nmap and found only 80 open indicating a webserver.

      <description>This was an Active Directory box that required some solid enumeration for the foothold and we got to have some fun in Bloodhound to get over the finish.
Enumeration I started out my enumeration as is typical with nmap.

      <description>Automating the configuration of new Kali VM&amp;rsquo;s As I frequently use virtual machines, specifically Kali Linux, for various capture the flags and courses, it is always a hassle to reinstall on a new computer, or if something breaks. I have had a bit of experience with ansible in the past, and have talked with people who have made their own scripts to automate configuring new installations but never got around to doing it myself.</description>

      <description>HTB &amp;ldquo;Montverde&amp;rdquo; Writeup Montverde is a medium rank Active Directory Box on HTB that had some interesting twists on the privesc, but classic AD on the initial access.
Enumeration We can start out with an nmap scan.

      <description>THM &amp;ldquo;Attacktive Directory&amp;rdquo; Writeup This is a room in TryHackMe dedicated to performing attacks on active directory and kerberos.
Enumeration To begin we will begin with our standard all ports, scripts, and services nmap scan. I will also run some stuff like enum4linux since I know this is an AD box.

      <guid>https://contactroberts.com/blog/07-08-thm-wreath/</guid>
      <description>THM &amp;ldquo;Wreath&amp;rdquo; Write Up Wreath was a multi-machine network comprised of windows and linux machines focused on the concept of pivoting. There was a lot of other great tidbits in there as well like basic obsfucation and AV bypass, as well as compiling your own tools. Overall, I learned a lot here!
Initial Enumeration We have an initial IP to go off of so lets go ahead and throw nmap at it.</description>

      <description>HTB &amp;ldquo;Buff&amp;rdquo; Writeup &amp;ldquo;Buff&amp;rdquo; is an easy windows box that has been retired. It had a nice exploit from some outdated software for the initial access and required some port forwarding trickery for the privesc.
Enumeration We can start with nmap.
1[~/htb/buff]$ nmap -p- -Pn 10.10.10.198 2Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-07-06 19:36 EDT 3Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.198 4Host is up (0.033s latency). 5Not shown: 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response) 6PORT STATE SERVICE 77680/tcp open pando-pub 88080/tcp open http-proxy 7680 is not a port that I recognize here.</description>

      <description>HTB Querier Writeup Enumeration First I did my initial nmap scans and scans with scripts and service detection.
